## Introduction
For our design assignment we chose to design and implement an admin website for web hosting and design company, Bazinga Hosting.
We implemented this website using the MySQL database managment system (DBMS), HTML & CSS and PHP. We chose to design a website for
a web hosting and design company because Ash has previous experience on how such a company operates and also because we thought it
was relevant to the module.
